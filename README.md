This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

In order to practice React, I have tried to reproduce (with ReactJS )the main features 
of a form found on the following page  : 

[OddsMonkey](https://www.oddsmonkey.com/Tools/Calculator.aspx)



### How to install and run the form : 

Install the dependencies via terminal : 

```
npm install 
```

Then you can run it : 

```
npm run start 
```


### How the form works : 

FakeOddsMonkey form allows you to do [matched betting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matched_betting): you enter 
the back stake and the odds of the bookmaker (in blue), then 
you enter the odds/commission of the 
exchange platform (in pink). The Lay stake is then automatically
 computed, and displayed in real time on the form. 

You can choose one of two options by clicking on the button at the top of the page:
"Qualyfing Bet" Or "Stake No Return"
